s = input("What is your name?")
print(len(s))


#100 days solution:
#This code prints the number of characters in a user's name.
#print( len( input("What is your name? ") ) )

#Notes
#If input was "Jack"
#1st: print(len("Jack"))
#2nd: print(4)

#Alternitive:
#name = input("What is your name?")
#length = len(name)
#print(length)
